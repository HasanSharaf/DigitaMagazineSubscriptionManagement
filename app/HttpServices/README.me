Microservice Communication Structure in Laravel

This repository contains a folder structure demonstrating
 how to implement microservice communication in a Laravel application using the Laravel framework
 and the concept of micros services. The structure allows for communication between different services

Structure Overview

The project folder contains the following components:
* ServiceInterface.php: Defines the contract for service classes to handle HTTP requests.
* BaseService.php: Provides common functionality for making HTTP requests to other services. This includes logic for handling both direct access and accessing services via the authentication service.
* Services: Contains service classes responsible for handling HTTP requests to other services. Each service class extends the BaseService class and implements the ServiceInterface.

How to Use

1. Place the folder structure in your Laravel project's 'app' directory.
2. Use the provided service classes in your Project to interact with other microservices.
    You can extend the functionality by creating additional service classes as needed.
3. Make sure to update the config/microservice.php file to add Auth Service Base Url.
